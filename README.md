# SCP:  Secret Labs - SpectatorDisabler
When a player dies they are put into the tutorial role to prevent them from spectating the other players. This stops them from respawning with the knowledge of who is still alive and where they currently are.

## Installation
- Make sure you have the [EXILED framework](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED) installed
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/zochris/SCPSL-SpectatorDisabler/releases)
- Drop the .dll into your `%appdata%\Plugins` directory (`~/.config/Plugins` if on Linux)
- Restart or reload your server
